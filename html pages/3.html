        <h2>Real-World Applications of Intelligent Machines</h2>
        <p>The journey from theoretical machine to practical tool is defined by the applications of AI.
            Today, dedicated algorithms power crucial systems in nearly every sector, transforming how
            we live, work, and discover.</p>

        <h2>Computer Vision: Seeing the World</h2>
        <p>Computer Vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information (images and videos). 
            It is the backbone of automated surveillance, facial recognition, and self-driving cars. 
            This field primarily relies on complex "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)" that learn
            features layer by layer, starting from basic edges to complex objects.

            <li>"Medical Diagnostics:" Analyzing X-rays and MRIs to detect tumors or disease patterns faster than human doctors.</li>
            <li>"Autonomous Vehicles:"" Real-time object detection (pedestrians, traffic signs, other cars) to navigate safely.</li>
            <li>"Quality Control:" Detecting defects in manufacturing assembly lines with high precision.</li>

        <h2>Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding Humanity</h2>
        <p>NLP is the branch of AI that gives computers the ability to read, understand, and generate human language.
            Modern NLP is driven by large "Transformer models" (like the ones powering the large language models), 
            which can grasp context and nuance across entire documents, not just single words.</p>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>Key NLP Tools</h3>
            <p><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Determining the emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) 
                of text data from reviews or social media. This helps businesses gauge public opinion.</p>
            <p><strong>Machine Translation:</strong> Providing instant, high-quality translation between languages while preserving contextual meaning.</p>

    <section id="automation">
        <h2>Autonomous Systems &amp; Robotics: Learning by Doing</h2>
        <p>AI is increasingly used to control physical systems. This is often achieved through
            "Reinforcement Learning (RL)", where an agent learns the optimal course of action by receiving rewards 
            or penalties based on its interaction with a dynamic environment.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>"Self-Driving:" The RL agent learns to balance speed, safety, and adherence to traffic laws.</li>
            <li>"Industrial Robotics:" Robots learn to perform complex maneuvers (e.g., picking, packing, welding) by optimizing for efficiency and speed.</li>
